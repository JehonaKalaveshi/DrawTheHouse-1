# DrawTheHouse
The game is called "draw the house".
The objective is to throw a die repeatedly, and based on the outcome, draw parts
of a house. A throw of 6 lets one draw the building, a square; a throw of 5 lets
one draw the roof; a throw of 4 lets one draw the door; and a throw of 3 lets one
draw a window. (There are two windows.) The flnished house looks something
